# Merge-Sort-Logo-style
A funny toy beginners can learn to build

A lot of people love the Merge Sort - because it is funny.
Seymour Papert and Brian Harvey wrote fun books about the Logo dialect of List Processing.
The Logo dialect uses language in a similar way to natural English.
The selector first-item chooses the first item of a list.
The selector without-first-item returns the list without the first item.
The selector last-item chooses the last item of a list.
The selector without-last-item returns the list without the last item.
The constructor add-to-beginning adds an item to the beginning of a list.
The constrctor add-to-end adds an item to the end of a list.
The constructor combine-lists combines two lists into one list.
The question empty? asks if a list is empty.
The question less-than? asks if a number is less than another number.
The question more-than? asks if a number is more than another number.
The word empty-list represents the empty list.
